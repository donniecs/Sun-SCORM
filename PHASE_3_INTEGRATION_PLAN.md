- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Admin Dashboard**: Multi-tenant organization management
- **Course Management**: SCORM course upload and persistence
- **API Gateway**: Centralized routing and microservices architecture
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js with React and TypeScript

**✅ PHASE 3 COMPONENTS (Implemented):**
- **ZIP Generator**: Dynamic SCORM dispatch package creation
- **Launch Endpoint**: Secure course launch with license validation
- **Download Endpoint**: Admin ZIP download functionality
- **Enhanced Admin UI**: Statistics and download integration

**🔗 INTEGRATION GAPS (Need to Address):**
1. **Frontend-Backend Connection**: Ensure seamless API communication
2. **User Flow Integration**: Connect dispatch creation to course management
3. **Admin Dashboard Enhancement**: Fully integrate Phase 3 features
4. **Navigation Consistency**: Unified navigation experience
5. **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across all components

## 🏗️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION

### **Current Architecture** (Confirmed Working)
```
Frontend (Next.js) ←→ API Gateway ←→ Database (PostgreSQL)
     ↓                     ↓                    ↓
  React Pages         Express Routes      Prisma ORM
     ↓                     ↓                    ↓
 Admin Dashboard    Dispatch Routes        Data Models
```

### **Integration Points** (Phase 3 Enhanced)
- **`/admin/dispatch`** ←→ **`/api/dispatches`** ←→ **Dispatch Table**
- **`/admin/dispatch`** ←→ **`/api/v1/dispatches/:id/download`** ←→ **ZIP Generator**
