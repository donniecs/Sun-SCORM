## üìã COMMAND REFERENCE

### Quick Start Commands
```powershell
# Full deployment
.\scripts\deploy.ps1 -Environment production -Build -Clean

# Database setup
.\scripts\setup-database.ps1 -Environment production

# Run tests
.\scripts\test-deployment.ps1

# Build images
.\scripts\build-docker.ps1

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

### Troubleshooting
- **Service not starting**: Check `docker-compose logs <service-name>`
- **Database connection issues**: Verify DATABASE_URL and credentials
- **Port conflicts**: Check if ports 3000-3006 are available
- **Performance issues**: Monitor resource usage with `docker stats`
