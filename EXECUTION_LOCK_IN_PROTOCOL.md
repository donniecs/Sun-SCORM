# üìò EXECUTION LOCK-IN PROTOCOL

Before starting any prompt ‚Äî no matter how small ‚Äî you must:

‚úÖ Re-read these three documents in full, every time:
1. `MISSION_CRITICAL_ALIGNMENT.md`
2. `E-Learning Platform Research Blueprint_.md`
3. `copilot-instructions.md`

You may NOT summarize them and move on. You must actively reprocess the operational rules, structural directives, and platform vision from all three.

---

## üîÅ BEFORE ANY EXECUTION

You must confirm:

1. Have you fully re-read and re-ingested all 3 documents above?
2. Does the prompt you are about to act on violate **any directive** in those documents?
3. Have you confirmed that this task does NOT overlap or duplicate any existing system, service, route, or module?

If any of these answers are unclear or uncertain ‚Äî HALT IMMEDIATELY and request clarification from ChatGPT.

---

## üß† NO SYSTEM OVERLAP

As we move deeper into implementation, **you are prohibited from generating any new services, data models, or folders** that have *any chance of already existing*. You must verify what's already in the system before building anything.

Do not create:
- Redundant auth systems
- Multiple LRS services
- Duplicate SCORM launchers
- Re-scaffolded folders

---

## ‚úÖ FINAL INSTRUCTION

You are not permitted to start any coding or file generation unless all three documents above have been freshly read and applied.

This is not optional. This is operational law.

Re-confirm every time.

---

## üîí PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT

This document serves as the **FIRST CHECKPOINT** for all future prompts. Every execution must begin with this protocol validation.

**OPERATIONAL SEQUENCE:**
1. Read EXECUTION_LOCK_IN_PROTOCOL.md ‚Üê **START HERE**
2. Read MISSION_CRITICAL_ALIGNMENT.md
3. Read E-Learning Platform Research Blueprint_.md  
4. Read copilot-instructions.md
5. Verify compliance with all directives
6. Execute only if all checks pass

This protocol is now **LOCKED IN** as operational law for all future development tasks.
