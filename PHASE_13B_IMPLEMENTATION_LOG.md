1. **Dispatch Management**
   - Create dispatches with configurable access modes (capped, unlimited, time-bound)
   - Link courses to specific tenant organizations
   - Set expiration dates and usage limits
   - Enable/disable analytics collection

2. **Launch Token System**
   - Generate secure launch URLs for external users
   - Optional email-based user identification
   - Single-use token validation
   - Automatic expiration handling

3. **Usage Tracking**
   - Real-time statistics on dispatch utilization
   - Launch and completion tracking
   - Capacity monitoring and alerts
   - Analytics dashboard integration

4. **Admin Interface**
   - Intuitive dispatch creation and management
   - Visual progress indicators and usage statistics
   - Launch history and user management
   - Bulk operations and filtering

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema (Prisma)
```prisma
model Dispatch {
  id             String @id @default(cuid())
  courseId       String
  tenantId       String
  mode           DispatchMode
  maxUsers       Int?
  expiresAt      DateTime?
  allowAnalytics Boolean @default(true)
  createdAt      DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt      DateTime @updatedAt
  
  course Course @relation(fields: [courseId], references: [id])
  tenant Tenant @relation(fields: [tenantId], references: [id])
  users  DispatchUser[]
  
  @@map("dispatches")
}

model DispatchUser {
  id          String @id @default(cuid())
  dispatchId  String
  email       String?
  launchToken String @unique
  launchedAt  DateTime?
  completedAt DateTime?
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  
  dispatch Dispatch @relation(fields: [dispatchId], references: [id])
  
  @@map("dispatch_users")
}

enum DispatchMode {
  capped
  unlimited
  time_bound
}
```

### API Endpoints Implemented

1. **POST /dispatch** - Create new dispatch
2. **GET /dispatch** - List all dispatches with statistics
3. **GET /dispatch/:id** - Get specific dispatch details
4. **PATCH /dispatch/:id** - Update dispatch settings
5. **DELETE /dispatch/:id** - Remove dispatch
6. **POST /dispatch/:id/launch** - Generate launch token
7. **GET /launch/:token** - Validate and launch course

### Frontend Components

#### Admin Dispatch Page (`/admin/dispatch`)
- Comprehensive dispatch management interface
- Real-time statistics and progress tracking
- Modal-based dispatch creation
